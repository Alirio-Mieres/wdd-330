      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>This week I learned about objects, when we talk about objects in programming we mean entities that can be
        represented in real life, like a car or a motorcycle. These objects have certain properties that characterize
        them, for example, the car has wheels, an engine, doors, etc. They also have functionalities like forward or
        slow down, this is known as a method. In short, objects have properties (the values that characterize them) and
        methods (functions that belong to that object).</p>
      <p>In JavaScript, objects are collections that have keys and values. As I said before they can contain any
        JavaScript value, the methods are functions of the object. They can also change their values or even delete
        them. </p>
      <p>JavaScript has built-in objects that have useful methods that help solve various problems. "JSON" stands for
        JavaScript Object Notation, it is a lightweight format used to exchange information. There is also the "Math"
        object which contains mathematical constants like PI and also has methods to solve mathematical problems. The
        "Date" object is used to get the current date and can be manipulated to display the date in different ways.</p>

      <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
      <p>"this" is a JavaScript keyword that behaves differently depending on the context in which it is used. For
        example, when "this" is used inside a method, it refers to the object that contains the method on which it is
        invoked. When a function is declared, we can use "this", but it has no value until the function is called.</p>

      <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>
      <p>DOM stands for The Document Object Model, according to the book JAVASCRIPT: NOVICE TO NINJA "represents an HTML
        document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure." This is not part of JavaScript but
        has been widely used with this language. In short, the DOM is used to modify a web page in different ways, you
        can get, delete, modify, add and even change the order of the elements of a web page.</p>
      <p>The most used to access elements of a page are document.getElementById() (this is used only to access a
        specific element with an id) and document.querySelector() (which can have id or class, we must place the "# " or
        "." sign depending on the situation).</p>
      <p>An element's attributes can be accessed with getAttribute() and can be updated or modified with setAttribute().
        A new element can be created using createElement() and createTextNode(), these can be added with appendChild()
        and insertBefore(). They can also be replaced using replaceChild(). innerHTML se usa para insertar código HTML
        sin ser procesado por el DOM.</p>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</li>
        <li>An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</li>
        <li>The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and
          methods relating to the event.</li>
        <li>You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</li>
        <li>There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.</li>
        <li>You can remove an event using the "removeEventListener" method.</li>
        <li>Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</li>
      </ul>

<!--<h2>Notes</h2>
<h4> Object Methods: this</h4>
<p>An object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job. To access the object, a method can use the "this" keyword</p>
<p>The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.</p>

 <h4>Objects</h4>
  <p>To create an object literal  I must enter a pair of curly braces </p>
  <p>I can access the properties of an Object using the dot notation or using bracket notation</p>
  <p>Properties and Methods can changed or removed and can be  used as parameters to functions</p>
  <p>JSON is a portable data format to exchange information</p>

 <h4> Document Object Model</h4>
 <p>DOM is a way of representing a page of a pages HTML as a tree of nodes</p>

 <h4> Events</h4>
 <p>HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.</p> -->
