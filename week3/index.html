  <h3>Week 3 Exercises</h3>

  <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The value of this is defined at run-time.</li>
    <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.</li>
    <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
    <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Objects</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}.</li>
  <li>Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as a method.</li>
  <li>Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.</li>
  <li>JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.</li>
  <li>Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.</li>
      <li>The document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.</li>
      <li>The parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.</li>
      <li>An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.</li>
      <li>The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</li>
      <li>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the "style" property.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Events</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</li>
    <li>An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</li>
    <li>The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.</li>
    <li>You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</li>
    <li>There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.</li>
    <li>You can remove an event using the "removeEventListener" method.</li>
    <li>Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</li>
  </ul>
