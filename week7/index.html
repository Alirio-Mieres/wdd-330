      <h3>Further Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions in Javascript are first-class objects, which means they can have their properties and methods.
        Functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has. They also have a call()
        and apply() methods that are used to set the value of "this" for an object that will be supplied as an argument
        to that function.The first argument for these functions is always "this", if the function needs more arguments
        it should be placed after "this". The apply() method is similar to the call() method, the difference is that the
        arguments are provided as an array. We can also create custom properties, like adding the function description.
        We can make a property (cache) that stores the results of the function, so if the same argument is entered,
        instead of calculating it again, the function will return the value stored in that property (cache).</p>

      <p>IIFE are Immediately invoked function expressions are functions that are enclosed in parentheses by placing
        double parentheses at the end of the function definition. Variables that are declared inside these functions are
        temporary and are removed after the function has been declared. It can be used as an initialization code that
        will not be used later. Another interesting thing is that it can also be used in strict mode. Functions in
        Javascript have various forms. There are redefined functions that change depending on certain conditions. The
        recursive function will keep calling itself until a certain condition has been met. A callback is a function
        that is passed as an argument to another function.</p>

      <p>Callbacks are used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop, a program can continue executing
        while waiting for another task to complete. Promises represent the future result of an asynchronous operation.
        Promises can be used instead of callbacks, as they provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors. There is also
        the chaining of multiple promises if each function that performs the asynchronous operation returns a promise,
        we can chain the "then" methods to form a sequential code.</p>

      <p>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions. Another thing I learned was about
        closures, a closure is a process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the
        function that originally defined it. A generator function is a special function used to produce iterators that
        hold the state of a value.</p>
      
        <p>Functional programming focuses on dividing processes into a series of steps that are implemented as functions.
        Pure functions do not depend on the state of the code from which they are called and have no side effects.</p>
