      <h3>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h3>
      <p>This week I learned about the CSS properties that allow transformations (2D) and transitions. Through the
        "transform" property we can translate, rotate, scale or skew any element. We can manipulate the appearance of
        elements using transformation functions. The "transform" property has as its value one or more transformation
        functions. This week I learned about two-dimensional transformations.</p>
      <p>Allows you to move items left, right, up, or down. An element that is manipulated with translation can only be
        moved relative to its current position. The translate function has two parameters, the first move the element
        from the left and the second from the top. The scale function increases or decreases the size of the element.
        Scale function is defined by two factors the first being horizontal and the second being vertical.It is
        important to remember that it grows outward or inward from its center, through the transform-origin property we
        can alter this behavior. We can rotate an element with the rotate function, generally, the values entered in the
        function are declared in degrees, positive values rotate clockwise if negative it rotates counterclockwise.</p>
