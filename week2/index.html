      <h4> In JavaScript there are two types of comment:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Single line comments starting with "//" and finishing at the end of the line</li>
        <li>Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */</li>
        <li>A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces. Blocks do not need to be
          terminated by a semicolon.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Symbol</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Null</li>
        <p>Any value that isnâ€™t one of the primitive data types listed above is an object. These include arrays,
          functions
          and object literals, which will be discussed in later chapters.</p>
      </ul>

      <h4>JavaScript has a special operator called typeof for finding out the type of a value.
        Here are some examples of the different value types: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#"><span onclick="practiceTypeof(typeof1)">typeof "Hello World"</span></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"><span onclick="practiceTypeof(typeof2)">typeof 10</span></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"><span onclick="practiceTypeof(typeof3)">typeof true</span></a></li>
        <li><a href="#"><span onclick="practiceTypeof(typeof4)">typeof {ninja: 'turtle'};</span></a></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Variables</h4>
      <p>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.</p>
      <p>JavaScript uses the keywords <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables. The keyword
        <strong></strong>const is used when the variable will
        not be reassigned to another value, whereas <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned
        later in the program.
      </p>
      <p>To assign a value to a constant or variable, we use the = operator. For example:</p>
      <p>const name = "Alirio"</p>

      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>Using <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables means they are block scoped, so
        their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.</p>

      <h5>Local Scope</h5>
      <p>In ES6, blocks can be used to create a local scope. This means that any variables defined inside a block using
        the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block. This is
        known as having local scope, as the variable is only visible in the locality of the block.</p>

      <h5>Global Scope</h5>
      <p>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is accessible everywhere
        in the program. While this may seem to be a good idea at first, it is not considered good practice.</p>

      <h4>Converting Between Strings and Numbers</h4>
      <p>We can convert numbers to strings and vice versa using a variety of methods.</p>

      <h5>Converting Strings to Numbers</h5>
      <p>The best way to convert a string to a number is to use the "Number" method, since it is less error-prone, a
        good practice is to avoid coercion of different values.</p>
      <p>Example: </p>
      <p>Number("10")<br>
        result: 10</p>
      <p>Note: If the string cannot be converted into a number, then NaN is returned.</p>

      <h5>Converting Numbers to Strings</h5>
      <p>The preferred way of changing a number to a string is to use the String function</p>
