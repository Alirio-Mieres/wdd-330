        <h3>Programming Basics</h3>
        <h4> In JavaScript there are two types of comment:</h4>
        <p>
          Single line comments starting with "//" and finishing at the end of the line<br>
          Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */<br>
          A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces. Blocks do not need to be
          terminated by a semicolon.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.
          There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.
          Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.
          Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.
          Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.
          Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.Data types can be
          converted into other data types.
          Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an
          operation.
          Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.
          Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
        <p>Arrays are an ordered list of values.
          Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays.
          Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array.
          Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values.
          Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs.
          We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code.
          The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statementsA for loop works in a similar way
          to a while loop, but has a different syntax.
          A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array.
          Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop.</p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.
          Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating a function
          expression by assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
          All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.
          A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like
          a variable inside the functionâ€™s body.
          An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.
          The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the
          function using index notation.
          The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.
          Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.
          Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.
          Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of
          the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.
          A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.
