      <h3>The Window Object</h3>
      <p>This week I learned that every JavaScript environment has a global object, global variables are properties of
        the global object, also some functions are methods of this object. In web browser environments the global object
        is the window object, this object represents the browser window that contains the web page. The Browser Object
        Model or BOM is a collection of properties and methods that contains information about the browser and the
        computer screen. It is always important to remember that the BOM works only in the browser environment.</p>
      <p>
        There are three functions that produce dialogs in the browser: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). These functions
        are not part of JavaScript but are supported by browsers, they work as methods of the window object. The alert()
        function displays a message on the screen. The confirm() function displays a message on the screen that gives
        the user the option to click on the “ok” or “cancel” button, it is used to confirm an action. The prompt()
        function will do the same thing as confirm but with the difference that it allows the user to enter text. All
        these functions will stop the execution of the program and it will not continue until we select an option, this
        sometimes makes the user experience not good, so it is important to analyze well where they will be used.
      </p>
      <p>The window object has various properties and methods that provide information about the user, the browser they
        are using, and even the protocol being used. The window object has the property “navigator” and refers to the
        browser object, this object has a property called “userAgent”, which returns information about the browser and
        the user. There is also the "location" property, which contains information about the URL of the page, through
        its properties: href, host, protocol, hostname, port, pathname, search, hash, origin, etc. "history" property
        that is used to access information about the pages visited during a user's session.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can open, close, resize, and move windows. The window.screen object provides information about the user's
        screen. I also learned about the document.write() method, which is an old method used to write text to the
        document, it is bad practice to use it, it is best to avoid it. Cookies can be used to store small pieces of
        information between requests using the document.cookie property. The window.setTime() method is used to call a
        function after the set time. Also window.requestAnimationFrame() is used to make animations, the most
        recommended is to use CSS because it is a more optimal way.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
      <p>HTML5.1 is the latest version of the hypertext markup language which brings a lot of functionality, it includes
        several APIs that can be accessed through JavaScript. The "data-" attribute helps embed custom data in a web
        page that can then be used to improve the user experience with JavaScript.</p>
      <p>The storage API allows user information to be saved in the browser through key-value pairs, it is somewhat
        similar to cookies, but it has some benefits such as it is not necessary to save them through the server and it
        allows a larger amount of storage.</p>
      <p>I also learned about the geolocation API to obtain the geographical location of the user, this allows knowing
        their exact location, if they are traveling, you can also know the speed. To have this functionality the user
        must grant permission for it to work.</p>
      <p>
        Websockets is a new protocol for communication over the internet and allows two-way communication in real time.
        The Web Worker API can be used to perform background tasks which solves the problem of JavaScript being a single
        threaded language. The Notification API allows us to display notifications on the user's system.
      </p>
      <P>
        The “audio” and “video” elements can be used to embed audio tracks and video clips on a web page. The "canvas"
        element is used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text or images on a web page in real time using
        JavaScript.
      </P>
      <p>A shim and polyfill are code snippets used to add functionality that is not supported by older browsers.</p>
