      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this application is to share with Pokemon fans a long list of their favorite characters, with
        information on health, attack, speed, etc.</p>
      <h3>Personal Purpose</h3>
      <p>In last week's activity, I saw the pokeAPI and it caught my attention, I have also played and enjoyed pokemon.
        I saw that with this API you can create this type of Pokedex, that is, a user interface that allows you to see
        different types of pokemon and their characteristics.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is traditional and new Pokemon fans. This application allows parents and children to enjoy their
        favorite video game saga.</p>
      <h3>Data sources</h3>
