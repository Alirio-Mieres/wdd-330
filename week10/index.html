      <h3>Client-side form validation</h3>
      <p>This week I learned more about client-side validations and the benefits it brings. The client-side validations
        help users to have a better experience, if these validations are not used, the errors will be sent to the
        server, it will do the validation and it will take time to load, having client-side validations makes this
        process faster and more dynamic. Despite these benefits, it's important to always perform server-side validation
        because malicious users can manipulate JavaScript code. There are three key points by which we do these
        validations, we obtain the data of the users correctly and in a good format, we protect the data of our users
        and we protect our application.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to do client-side validation, through the HTML5 API and through JavaScript (which allows us
        to do it in a custom way). HTML5 form control validation allows you to validate most data without JavaScript, it
        works like attributes on form elements. among them are "required", "min and max", "minlength and maxlength",
        "type" and "pattern". "pattern" uses regular expressions to specify the desired pattern, and "type" specifies
        the types of data to be entered (numbers, email, etc.).</p>
      <p>The main attribute is the "required", if the input has no value, it will have the status of ":invalid", but if
        the element has a valid value, it will have the value: "valid", this allows you to give custom layouts to the
        forms. It's also important that we let users know what inputs are required and use this attribute on the most
        important inputs. The minlength and maxlength attribute allow you to specify the number of characters the user
        can enter. A better user experience than just using maxlength is to also provide
        character count feedback in an accessible manner and let them edit their content down to size. The constraint
        validation API is used to make more personalized validations, through JavaScript we can add personalized
        messages for a specific situation.
      </p>
      <h3>Using the Fetch API</h3>
      <p>
        The fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as
        requests and responses. It has a fetch method that allows us to get the data in an easier way and get the
        resources asynchronously. The "Headers" interface allows you to create your own header object via a header()
        constructor, represents response/request headers, allowing you to query them and take different actions
        depending on the results. "Request" represents a resource request. "Response" Represents the response to a
        request.
