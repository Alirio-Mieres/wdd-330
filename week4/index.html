      <h3>Forms</h3>
      <p>Forms are one of the ways the user can interact with a web page. To make a form we use the HTML "form" tag. The
        forms have controls that are: input (fields used to fill in information such as passwords, personal
        information,
        or emails), selection (used for drop-down lists), text area (it is a text input, sometimes used so that the
        user
        can make comments), button (the element used to submit forms).</p>
      <p>This week I learned about the properties and methods that forms have. The "submit" method causes the form to be
        submitted automatically, a thing interesting is that a form can be manually submitted by adding a button or
        input
        with a submit type. There is also the "reset" method which resets the controls to their default HTML values, one
        caveat given by the book JAVASCRIPT: NOVICE NINJA is that the reset buttons are considered poor, due to being
        too
        easy to click and removing all the fields that the user filled in, so if you add a button with the type reset,
        there must be a good reason to do so.</p>
      <p>This week I also learned about various types of input such as checkbox (used for the user to choose several of
        the available options), password, radio button (used for the user to choose only one of the available options).
      </p>
      <p>Something interesting that I was able to learn more about this week is about form validations, these
        validations
        can be done through the server and on the client-side. Validations are always performed on the backend so that
        users can enter valid values to register them in the database. On the frontend, validations can also be done via
        JavaScript, by performing client-side validations, you get the benefit of fewer HTTP queries because, through
        client-side validations, the user is notified about required fields or entered errors. One of the nice things
        that
        HTML5 introduced is an API to do automatic validation via the "required" attribute.</p>
      <p>I also learned about the "value" property of form controllers, which allows you to read or modify information
        entered into the form. I also learned about the "focus", "blur" and "change" events that fire when the user
        interacts with the form.</p>

      <h3>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>It is a programming paradigm that uses objects that encapsulate their properties and methods. This paradigm
        consists of separating the code into related pieces encapsulated in objects, which makes maintenance or
        modification of the program easier.</p>
      <p>In object-oriented programming, there are three important things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation: it consists in that the internal maintenance of the object remains hidden and only the
          essential functionalities are shown to the end-user.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism: means that the same process can be used for different objects, for example, that several
          objects can have the same methods.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: It means that an object can inherit all the properties and methods of an existing object, also
          more properties and methods can be added if needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In JavaScript there are constructor functions, these can have properties, methods and we can also create
        instances of that object. The latest versions of JavaScript have integrated the "class" declaration that is
        similar to that of other programming languages, it also works as a prototype of an object and can be
        instantiated. One important thing is that, by convention, constructor functions and functions are capitalized.
        It's also important to remember that the "this" keyword refers to the object returned by the function.
      </p>
      <h3>Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
      <p>
        Like other programming languages, JavaScript has libraries, these tools have methods that make tasks easier and
        faster to perform. Libraries can make the job easier, but sometimes the tasks we are trying to solve can be done
        with Vanilla js code because libraries can slow down our application. The advantage of using libraries is that
        many of their methods are tested, have large communities, and are constantly being updated. Another important
        thing I read about was modules, which are pieces of code in separate files that provide functions and methods
        that can be used in other files and by other modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        MVC stands for Model-View-Controller is a pattern used for server-side development but can also be used in
        javaScript for larger applications. Model are objects that implement the functionality to create, read, update
        and delete specific pieces of information about the application, this is known as CRUD tasks. The views
        guarantee a visual representation of the model that shows the relevant information, in the case of web
        development it would be our HTML code. Controllers are what link models and views, respond to events that are
        usually user input, and update the application.
      </p>

      <p>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming
        logic to be used to generate markup. Two very famous libraries are React and Vue.js, which make it easy to
        update the UI, they use a virtual DOM concept to speed up the process of updating HTML pages. A concept of
        components is also used to make visual elements, this has the advantage that several components can be made and
        then reused in other projects.
      </p>
      <p>The most important thing I learned from the book is that we need to start small with our main files, so if our
        project is large, it might be good to break it up into modules.</p>
