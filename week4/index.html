      <h3>Forms</h3>
      <p>Forms are one of the ways the user can interact with a web page. To make a form we use the HTML "form" tag. The
        forms have controls that are: input (fields used to fill in information such as passwords, personal
        information,
        or emails), selection (used for drop-down lists), text area (it is a text input, sometimes used so that the
        user
        can make comments), button (the element used to submit forms).</p>
      <p>This week I learned about the properties and methods that forms have. The "submit" method causes the form to be
        submitted automatically, a thing interesting is that a form can be manually submitted by adding a button or
        input
        with a submit type. There is also the "reset" method which resets the controls to their default HTML values, one
        caveat given by the book JAVASCRIPT: NOVICE NINJA is that the reset buttons are considered poor, due to being
        too
        easy to click and removing all the fields that the user filled in, so if you add a button with the type reset,
        there must be a good reason to do so.</p>
      <p>This week I also learned about various types of input such as checkbox (used for the user to choose several of
        the available options), password, radio button (used for the user to choose only one of the available options).
      </p>
      <p>Something interesting that I was able to learn more about this week is about form validations, these
        validations
        can be done through the server and on the client-side. Validations are always performed on the backend so that
        users can enter valid values to register them in the database. On the frontend, validations can also be done via
        JavaScript, by performing client-side validations, you get the benefit of fewer HTTP queries because, through
        client-side validations, the user is notified about required fields or entered errors. One of the nice things
        that
        HTML5 introduced is an API to do automatic validation via the "required" attribute.</p>
      <p>I also learned about the "value" property of form controllers, which allows you to read or modify information
        entered into the form. I also learned about the "focus", "blur" and "change" events that fire when the user
        interacts with the form.</p>

      <h3>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>It is a programming paradigm that uses objects that encapsulate their properties and methods. This paradigm
        consists of separating the code into related pieces encapsulated in objects, which makes maintenance or
        modification of the program easier.</p>
      <p>In object-oriented programming, there are three important things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation: it consists in that the internal maintenance of the object remains hidden and only the
          essential functionalities are shown to the end-user.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism: means that the same process can be used for different objects, for example, that several
          objects can have the same methods.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: It means that an object can inherit all the properties and methods of an existing object, also
          more properties and methods can be added if needed.</li>
      </ul>
