    <h3>Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3>
  <p><strong>Be there</strong><br>
    To help move someone along their decision journey, and deepen their loyalty.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Be useful</strong><br>
    Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn´t satisfy their needs.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Be quick</strong><br>
    It´s not just about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Reachability matters</strong><br>
    75% of people rely on thumbs and 49% use one handed grip.
