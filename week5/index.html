      <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
      <p>This week I learned about the possible errors that can occur when making a program. I learned that errors,
        exceptions, and warnings can occur. Errors occur when something goes wrong in the program and can be caused by
        systems (systems or devices that interact with the program), programmers (the program contains incorrect syntax
        or a typo), users (they may enter an invalid value or incorrect data). Programmer errors are our responsibility,
        so it is important to use tools that prevent errors and use good practices. User errors are also programmer
        errors because the system must be designed in such a way that the user knows what data to enter. Exceptions are
        errors that produce a return value that can then be used by the program to handle the error. A
        warning is a notice of an error in the code, but it is not big enough to crash the program.</p>
      <p>
        This week I also learned about strict mode, which produces more exceptions and warnings. Using
        strict code helps improve clarity and speed, because it forces the developer to implement best practices. To use
        strict mode, just place: 'use strict' in the first line of the JavaScript code. Strict mode can also be used
        inside a function, so it would only affect that function and not the whole file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linting tools can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code. They are used to highlight any bad programming
        practices. They are used to adhering to a style guide and are good for teamwork as everyone will follow the same
        conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important thing is feature detection. JavaScript programming is constantly changing, so some newer
        methods may not be available in older browsers. So to check for browser compatibility, feature detection is
        used, which is done by means of an "if" statement that checks if the object or method being called exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several methods to debug our code, among them is the alert() method that shows on the screen when an
        error occurs in our code (it is not something that is recommended to do), there is also the use of the console
        through the console.log(), which is used to record any errors that have occurred. Modern browsers have
        debugging tools, using breakpoints in our code will pause the program and we will be able to see the values of
        our variables at that point and modify them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exceptions can be thrown via the "throw" statement, which can be placed in any JavaScript expression and will
        stop the code when an error is encountered. Exceptions can be handled by the "try", "catch" and "finally"
        statements. When an error object is created, an exception is thrown. Any code inside a "try" will pass any error
        objects to a "catch" block when an exception occurs. "finally" will run after "try" and "catch" whether or not
        an exception is thrown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I learned was about test-driven development. It consists of writing tests before any real code,
        then writing the code to pass the tests, then refactoring the code to make it more optimal, then testing the
        refactored code, and finally writing more tests for new features. "Jest" is a framework that makes it easy to
        create and run tests.
